# Pulse Transmitter

Author: Han

Peripheral index: 11

## What it does
Pulse transmitter is a versatile peripheral that can transmit digital waveforms of various durations, with optional support for carrier modulation. Various schemes like Pulse Distance, Pulse Width, Manchester encoding, etc. can be easily implemented. Once the program has been configured, no CPU intervention is required. This makes it ideal for remote control transmitter applications and even makes it suitable to drive other devices like the WS2812B addressable LED, shift registers or I2S DACs.

### Specifications
- 256 bits of program data memory
- 24 bit duration counter (8 bit with prescaler)
- 11 bit carrier timer
- 8 + 1 bit program counter
- 8 bit program loop counter
- 4 configurable interrupts (not shown in the architecture diagram)

### Architecture
The program data memory stores the data for the symbols to be transmitted. These symbols are selected based on the program counter which allows the symbols to be transmitted one after another.

![Pulse Transmitter Architecture](11_pulse_transmitter_architecture.drawio.svg)

### What is a symbol?
![Pulse Transmitter Symbol](11_pulse_transmitter_symbol.drawio.svg)

The transmission level and duration is described by a 2-bit **symbol**.

| Bit 1          | Bit 0           |
|----------------|-----------------|
| TRANSMIT_LEVEL | DURATION_SELECT |

### Modes of operation
The pulse transmitter supports either 1bpe (default) or 2bpe mode.

| Mode                     | Description    |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| 1bpe (1 bit per element) | Support up to 256 elements, each 1-bit element is expanded to 2, 2-bit symbols via a lookup table. The program counter increments/decrements by 1 per element (2 symbols). |
| 2bpe (2 bit per element) | Support up to 128 elements, each 2-bit element is directly mapped to a 2-bit symbol. The program counter increments/decrements by 2 per element. As such `program_start_index`, `program_end_index` and `program_loopback_index` must be a multiple of 2. |

As described, in 1bpe mode, each bit in program data memory is expanded to 2 symbols.
| Value  | First symbol       |  Second symbol     |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 0      | low_symbol_0[1:0]  | low_symbol_1[1:0]  |
| 1      | high_symbol_0[1:0] | high_symbol_1[1:0] |

### Duration
Each 2-bit symbol has an associated duration value via one of the six lookup tables.

| Auxillary Bit | Symbol Bit 1 | Symbol Bit 0 | Evaluated Duration   |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------|
| 0             | 0            | 0            | main_low_duration_a  |
| 0             | 0            | 1            | main_low_duration_b  |
| 0             | 1            | 0            | main_high_duration_a |
| 0             | 1            | 1            | main_high_duration_b |
| 1             | X            | 0            | auxillary_duration_a |
| 1             | X            | 1            | auxillary_duration_b |

To allow for more flexibility in the durations, a 8 bit `auxillary_mask` enables auxillary duration to be used.
- In 1bpe mode, the auxillary mask is mapped to elements 0 to 7 (expanded to 16 symbols) in program data memory.
- In 2bpe mode, the auxillary mask is mapped to elements 0 to 7 (8 symbols) in program data memory.

There is also a 4 bit prescaler value each for main and auxillary.
Combined together, total duration ticks = (duration + 2) << prescaler.

### Carrier
The carrier timer is a 11 bit timer that generates a fixed 50% duty cycle square wave. Assuming a clock of 64 MHz, the minimum achievable frequency is approximately 15.6 KHz, while the maximum is 32 MHz. The total duration ticks of a full cycle (high and low) is 2 * (carrier_duration + 1). Note that the carrier output is initially low at the start of the program, and is active when the program is running on a seperate output pin even when `carrier_en` is disabled.

### Program counter
You can specify where in program data memory the program starts, stops, or loopback to. You can choose to not loop, loop a certain number of times or loop forever.

**Down counting**  
Instead of counting up, you can count down and effectively send bits in reverse.

⚠️In 1bpe mode, the order of the symbols sent **within** a element is not changed, ie. the first symbol is sent, then the second symbol is sent.

### Interrupts
Interrupts can be enabled for certain events like whenever a element is transmitted, whenever the program loops, whenever the program counter reaches the half of the full capacity, or when the program completes. This may be useful in helping to refill the program data memory manually (in the absence of a FIFO) to enable continuous transmission. Note that interrupts (if enabled) are not automatically cleared when the program is started/terminated; you have to deliberately clear it.

### Program status
You can check the program counter, the program loop counter and whether a program is running by reading this peripheral. This may be useful to check for the progress of the program or for busy-waiting for the completion of the program.

⚠️The `program_counter` and `program_loop_counter` may be ahead of the currently transmitted symbol as they are incremented/decremented **before** the completion of the transmission of the symbol as a means of prefetching the next symbol data.

## Writing
Only aligned 32 bit writes are supported in general. However, 8 bit write is allowed at address 0x00 to aid in clearing interrupts, starting or stopping the program.

A series of examples intended to be used with the above is presented.

#### [Example] NEC Remote Control Procotol
This protocol uses pulse distance encoding, and requires 38kHz modulation which is simple enough. However, there needs to be a 9 ms high, and 4.5ms low pulse to initiate the transmission. This can be handled by the auxillary mask. In this example, you should expect a command of value 88 (integer) to be sent to address 36 (integer) every 500ms.

    uint8_t address = 36;
    uint8_t command = 88;

    // Enable all outputs (ensure they are not in debug mode)
    enable_all_outputs();

#### [Example] WS2812B Addressable LED
The WS2812B needs the bits to be sent MSB (Most Significant Bit) first. Reversing the bits using the CPU is highly inefficient (at least without the bit reverse instruction). Thankfully, we can take advantage of a trick where program counter can count down instead, this effectively sends the bits in reverse. In this example, you should expect 2 connected WS2812B LEDs to light up and animate between colours. This animation loops forever.

#### [Extra Experimental Example] Driving Serial Devices like the 74HC595 Shift Register / SPI Mode 0/2 Devices
While the pulse transmitter peripheral is only single channel, signals like the `symbol_toggle_or_idle_output` and `carrier_or_zero_output` is exposed. The `symbol_toggle_or_idle_output` signal can be used as a clock signal for the 74HC595 Shift Register. The serial data in the program data memory can streamed out. In this example, you should expect the 8 shift register outputs to count in a binary sequence. This procedure loops forever.

#### [Extra Experimental Example] Driving Digital-to-analog Converters using Phillips I2S & Left/Right Justified
The pulse transmitter can be used to drive a suitable DAC like the PCM5102A which do not require a MCLK. While the peripheral is only single channel, signals like `symbol_toggle_or_idle_output` and `carrier_or_zero_output` is exposed. The `symbol_toggle_or_idle_output` signal can be used as a bit clock signal while the `carrier_or_zero_output` is used as the word clock. However, it may be non-trivial to output a bit clock frequency perfectly matches for example 32000 * 32 Hz. In this example, the stereo DAC is driven at a 32kHz sample rate. You should expect the a sawtooth tone of 440 Hz to be generated. Next, the previous tone is turned off, and a sawtooth tone of 660 Hz is generated. Next, both tones are simultaneously enabled. Next, both tones are disabled. This procedure loops forever. With a main clock frequency of 63.5 MHz, the error is less than 0.02%. With a main clock frequency of 64 MHz, the error is about 0.8%, this might still be acceptable to some DACs.

## External hardware
For testing with an IR LED, the output pins cannot deliver much current, so use a buffer or transistor to drive the LED.
