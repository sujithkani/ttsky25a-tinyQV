The peripheral index is the number TinyQV will use to select your peripheral.  You will pick a free
slot when raising the pull request against the main TinyQV repository, and can fill this in then.  You
also need to set this value as the PERIPHERAL_NUM in your test script.

You can also include images in this folder and reference them in the markdown. Each image must be less than

# CRC32 Peripheral

Author: Alessandro Vargiu

Peripheral index: 27

## What it does

This accelerator implements a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check), an error-detecting code used
in networking. This byte peripheral accumulates the CRC32 code, working on a byte of data each clock cycle. A set of registers are used to output a requested byte of the 32-bit CRC32 code.

| 0x00    | CLEAR     | W      | Clear CRC accumulated code                                             |
| 0x01    | COMPUTE   | W      | Compute CRC from new input on data_in                                  |
| 0x02    | CRC_BYTE0 | R      | Read byte [7:0] of CRC code in data_out                                |
| 0x03    | CRC_BYTE1 | R      | Read byte [15:8] of CRC code in data_out                               |
| 0x04    | CRC_BYTE2 | R      | Read byte [23:16] of CRC code in data_out                              |
| 0x05    | CRC_BYTE3 | R      | Read byte [31:24] of CRC code in data_out                              |

## How to test

The accelerator works in an accumulative fashion, meaning you feed one byte each clock cycle and the accelerator updates the CRC32 code.

1. Write any value to the CLEAR register (0x00) to reset the accumulated CRC32 code from previous computations.
2. Write input bytes to the COMPUTE register (0x01), the accelerator handles one byte per clock cycle.
3. The 32-bit CRC result is accessed by reading four separate byte registers. Each register returns one byte of the complete CRC value.
