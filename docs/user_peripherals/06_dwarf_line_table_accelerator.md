# DWARF Line Table Accelerator

Author: Laurie Hedge

Peripheral index: 6

## What it does

### Overview

The [DWARF file format](https://dwarfstd.org/) is used to store debug information for compiled programs. The line table, the mapping between machine code instructions and the source code it was compiled from, is encoded as a small program targeting an abstract machine. This peripheral is an accelerator for running these line table programs.

### Usage

The peripheral should first be reset at the start of day.

The peripheral communicates with the program driving execution of the line table program through interrupts, so an interrupt handler should be setup for the peripheral before attempting to use it.

To execute a program, first write the PROGRAM_HEADER register with the fields extracted from the program header in the DWARF file. The packed format of these fields is detailed in the PROGRAM_HEADER section. This will reset the abstract machine and prepare the peripheral for use.

Next, write the code of the program to the PROGRAM_CODE register in a loop. These writes can consist of 1, 2, or 4 bytes at a time, but all bytes must be part of the program. It is suggested to write as much of the program as possible using 4 byte writes, and only use 2 and 1 byte chunks for the remaining bytes at the tail of the program.

As the program is written, the peripheral may raise interrupts in a few cases. First, if the program hits a long running instruction and so cannot keep up with the speed of writes to PROGRAM_CODE, it will raise an interrupt and set STATUS to STATUS_BUSY. The interrupt handler should poll STATUS until it reads a value other than STATUS_BUSY. If the new status is STATUS_PAUSED, then the program should write any value to STATUS to continue execution. For any other status, the program should handle this exactly the same as if this were the original status of of the interrupt.

Second, when the program asks to emit a row of the line table, an interrupt will be raised with the STATUS set to STATUS_EMIT_ROW. This will pause the execution of the program, even if valid bytes still remain. This gives the interrupt handler the chance to read the abstract machine state from the AM registers and emit a row. To continue execution, write any value to STATUS.

Third, if a program hits an unknown instruction, it will raise an interrupt and set STATUS to STATUS_ILLEGAL. This error is unrecoverable. The program should be abandoned and the chip should be configured for its next program with a new write to PROGRAM_HEADER.

### Usage Example

The following pseudo-code outlines the expected usage of the peripheral.

```
def main():
	register_interrupt_handler(handle_dwarf_line_table_interrupt)
	line_table_program_header = read_line_table_program_header(dwarf_file)
	write_to_reg(PROGRAM_HEADER, pack(line_table_program_header))
	while next_code_chunk = read_code_chunk(dwarf_file):
		write_to_reg(PROGRAM_CODE, next_code_chunk)

def handle_dwarf_line_table_interrupt():
	status = read_from_reg(STATUS)
	while status == STATUS_BUSY:
		status = read_from_reg(STATUS)
	if status == STATUS_ILLEGAL:
		report_error_and_quit()
	if status == STATUS_EMIT_ROW:
		address        = read_from_reg(AM_ADDRESS)
		file_descrim   = read_from_reg(AM_FILE_DISCRIM)
		line_col_flags = read_from_reg(AM_LINE_COL_FLAGS)
		unpack_and_emit_row(address, file_descrim, line_col_flags)
	write_to_reg(STATUS, 0)
	mret()
```

### Limitations

This peripheral only supports version 5 of the DWARF format.

Unknown instructions raise an illegal instruction interrupt and halt termination of the program, rather than being silently ignored.

Since this peripheral was designed as a companion to the TinyQV CPU, it only support a limited subset of the full DWARF line table accelerator abstract machine. In particular, it has the following limitations.

* The `address` register is limited to 28 bits to match the number of physical address bits supported by TinyQV.
* The `op_index` register is not implemented since it is only used for VLIW, which are not applicable to RV32EC.
* The `file`, `line`, and `discriminator` registers are limited to 16 bits.
* The `column` register is limited to 10 bits.
* The `isa` register is not implemented since only RV32EC is supported.
* The `DW_LNE_define_file` extended opcode, which is deprecated in DWARF v5, is unimplemented, since there is no sensible way of implementing this instruction in a peripheral without greatly extending its scope.

### PROGRAM_HEADER

This register should be written with the fields read from the line table program header before the program starts.

Writing this register resets the peripheral state and configures the peripheral to run the program.

Reading the register returns the fields of the currently configured program (i.e. the same values that were last written, other than the unused field which will always contain 0).

| 31:24       | 23:16      | 15:8      | 7:1    | 0               |
|-------------|------------|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| opcode_base | line_range | line_base | unused | default_is_stmt |

### PROGRAM_CODE

This register should be written with the line table program code. It can be written in 1, 2, or 4 byte chunks, but every byte written must be part of the program code (no padding) so if the program code is not a multiple of 4 bytes, the 1 or 2 byte variants must be used to write the last bytes.

### AM_ADDRESS

This register should only be read when the peripheral has raised an interrupt and set the STATUS to STATUS_EMIT_ROW.

It contains the address to be emitted for this row.

### AM_FILE_DISCRIM

This register should only be read when the peripheral has raised an interrupt and set the STATUS to STATUS_EMIT_ROW.

It contains the file and discriminator to be emitted for this row.

| 31:16         | 15:0 |
|---------------|------|
| discriminator | file |

### AM_LINE_COL_FLAGS

This register should only be read when the peripheral has raised an interrupt and set the STATUS to STATUS_EMIT_ROW.

It contains the line, column, is_stmt, basic_block, end_sequence, prologue_end, and epilogue_begin to be emitted for this row.

| 31     | 30             | 29           | 28           | 27          | 26      | 25:16  | 15:0 |
|--------|----------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|---------|--------|------|
| unused | epilogue_begin | prologue_end | end_sequence | basic_block | is_stmt | column | line |

### STATUS

This register contains the current state of the peripheral. It should generally be read after an interrupt from the peripheral to interpret it.

If the register has the value STATUS_EMIT_ROW following an interrupt, writing the register will change STATUS back to STATUS_READY (regardless of the value written) and will make the peripheral resume executing the current program. After receiving a STATUS_EMIT_ROW interrupt, the row being emitted should be read and only after should STATUS be written.

If the register has the value STATUS_BUSY following an interrupt, it means that the peripheral is processing a long running special instruction. No further writes to PROGRAM_CODE can be made, and instead software should continue to poll STATUS until it changes to STATUS_EMIT_ROW, meaning that the row is ready to read. To resume, STATUS should be written as in the case where the status code had initially been STATUS_EMIT_ROW.

If the register has the value STATUS_ILLEGAL following an interrupt, it means that the program has stopped running due to hitting an illegal instruction. Writing to STATUS after an illegal instruction will reset the state of the peripheral so that it is ready to execute code again, but the state of the abstract machine will be reset.

**Status Codes**

| Code | Name            | Description |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| 0x00 | STATUS_READY    | Peripheral is ready to receive writes to PROGRAM_HEADER and PROGRAM_CODE. No interrupt has been raised. |
| 0x01 | STATUS_EMIT_ROW | Peripheral has raised an interrupt to indicate that a row has been emitted. Read the row from AM_ADDRESS, AM_FILE_DISCRIM, and AM_LINE_COL_FLAGS. |
| 0x02 | STATUS_BUSY     | Peripheral is busy processing instructions and cannot accept writes to PROGRAM_CODE at this time. |
| 0x03 | STATUS_ILLEGAL  | Peripheral has stopped due to hitting an illegal instruction. |
| 0x04 | STATUS_PAUSED   | Peripheral hit a long running instruction but has now finished executing it so is ready to continue. |
