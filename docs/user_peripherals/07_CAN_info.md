## What it does

This peripheral is a simplified CAN bus controller. A more detailed descriprion is included in the [PDF file](CANPerif.pdf)

## Register map

Document the registers that are used to interact with your peripheral.
All registers are 32-bit wide and are located at addresses multiple of 4:

| Address | Name  | Access | Description                                                          |
|---------|-------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x00    | ID    |   R    | bits <28:0>: received ID (only bits <10:0> valid for standard frames)|
|         |       |        | bit 30: RTR (remote request)                                         |
|         |       |        | bit 31: EXT (extended frame with 29-bit ID)                          |
|         |       |        |  (reading this reg. clears the FRMAV flag)                           |
|         |       |   W    | Same fields for transmitting                                         |
|---------|-------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x04    | DLCF  |  R/W   | DLC field, flags, baud divider, interrupt enable                     |
|         |       |        | bits <3:0> (R/W): DLC (rx DLC on reads, tx DLC on writes)            |
|         |       |        | bit 4 (RO): STUFF. Stuffing bit error on rx                          |
|         |       |        | bit 5 (RO): CRC. CRC error on rx                                     |
|         |       |        | bit 6 FRMAV (RO): Valid frame available on rx                        |
|         |       |        | bit 7 OVWR (RO): Overwrite. Frame received while FRMAV set           |
|         |       |        | bit 8 RTS (R/W): Request to send. Set to tx. Cleared when tx complete|
|         |       |        | bit 9 LOST (RO): Lost arbitration on tx                              |
|         |       |        | bit 10 BITER (RO): Bit error on tx (bus level != can_tx)             |
|         |       |        | bit 11 ACK (RO): tx frame was acknowledged by a receiver             |
|         |       |        | bits <25:16> (R/W): BAUDDIV. Bit rate = f_clk / (BAUDDIV+1)          |
|         |       |        | bit 29 INTERX (R/W): Enable rx interrupt (when FRMAV is set)         |
|         |       |        | bit 30 INTERR (R/W): Enable rx error interrupt (SFUFF or CRC set)    |
|         |       |        | bit 31 INTTX (R/W): Enable tx interrupt (when RTS is zero)           |
|---------|-------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x08    | DATA0 |   R    | Received data (bytes #0 to #3)                                       |
|         |       |   W    | Data to transmit (bytes #0 to #3)                                    |

## How to test

Frame sending:
- Write DATA0, and DATA1 if DLC>4, with the data of the frame.
- Write ID with the ID of the frame. Set bit #31 if this is an extended frame with a 29-bit ID. Set
  bit #30 if this is a Remote Request (RTR) frame.
- Write DLCF with the DLC value, the proper Baud divider, and bit #8 (RTS) set.
- Wait until RTS goes low.
- Check for ACK in DLCF. If not set check for lost arbitration or bit errors and repeat the procedure.
  (notice that all registers have to be rewritten after a transmission)

Frame receiving:
- Write DLCF with the proper Baud divider.
- Wait until FRMAV in DLCF is set. If STUFF or CRC are set instead a wrong frame was received (it 
  can be discarded)
- Read the DATA0 and DATA1 registers. The number of valid bytes is in the DLC field of the DLCF reg.
- Read the ID register. This clears the FRMAV flag and a new frame can be received.
  (after FRMAV gets set we have a minimum time of 28 CAN bits before an overwriting error)


## External hardware

CAN_TX output is located on uo_out[1]. CAN_RX input is located on ui_in[1]. These pins ough to be
connected to a can bus transceiver in order to communicate with other nodes in the CAN bus.
