# Rotary Encoder

Author: Matt Venn

Peripheral index: 16

## What it does

Reads up to 4 rotary (incremental) encoder: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_encoder

The a and b signals are first debounced at a configurable frequency.

The encoder counts from 0 to 255.

| 0x8000403    | ENC3  | R      | Value of Encoder 3                                                               |
| 0x8000404    | DPER  | R/W    | Debounce period. Value is left shifted by 6. Default 128 (8192) clock cycles |

## How to test

Connect up to 4 incremental encoders to the input port (see pin mapping).

Use the test firmware to read the value of the encoder and print it out.

Default debounce period should be fine at 64MHz, but might need tuning if you have noisy encoders or run at a different frequency.

## External hardware

Rotary incremental encoders. Most encoder Pmod boards have pull-up / pull-down resistors. If you are
using a bare encoder, you will need to add your own pull-up / pull-down resistors.
