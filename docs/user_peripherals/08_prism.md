## PRISM

Author: Ken Pettit

Peripheral index: 8

## What it does

This is a Programmable Reconfigurable Indexed State Machine (PRISM) that executes a Verilog coded Mealy state machine that is loaded via a configuration bitstream at runtime.

![](08_prism_periph.png)

The PRISM controller itself is a programmable state machine that uses an N-bit (3 in this case)
index register to track the current FSM state.  That index is a pointer into the State Information Table (SIT) to request the State Execution Word (STEW).

## Operating priciples of PRISM

PRISM supports FSM designs up to 8 states and includes controllable peripherals such as counters,
communication shift register, FIFO and interrupt support.  It also features an integrated debugger
with 2 breakpoints, single-stepping and readback of state information.  Due to long combinatorial
delays, PRISM operates from a divide-by-two clock (32Mhz max).  The following is a block diagram
of the PRISM controller:

Each state is encoded with a 44-bit (in the case of TinyQV PRISM) execution word that controls the
FSM output values, input values and state transition decision tree for that state.  The peripheral
is operated by loading a "Chroma" (more on that below), or execution personality in the 352 bit
configuration array and programming the 14-bit control word to set peripheral behaviors
(like choosing 24-bit shift register vs. 24-bit counter, choosing pin locations for shift data
in/out, etc.).

Once a chroma has been loaded, the control register programmed and the PRISM enabled, the FSM
will start at state 0.  Eight of the bits in the State Execution Word (STEW) specify which of
16 inputs get routed to the 2-input Look Up Table (LUT) that makes the decision for jumping to
the specified state (stored in 3 bits of the STEW).  While in any state, there is a set of 11
(from the STEW) output bits that drive the PRISM block outputs when the LUT output is zero
(no jump) and 11 more that are output during a jump (transitional outputs).

Each state also has an independent 16-input mux (4-bits from STEW) driving a 1-input LUT to
drive a "conditional output".  This is an output who's value is not strictly depedent on the
static values in the STEW for the current state, but rather depends on the selected input during
that state.

### State Looping (important)

In larger PRISM implementations, each state has "dual-compare" with two N-bit LUTs which allows
jumping to one of two possible states.  Due to size restrictions, this peripheral does not include
dual-compare.  Instead the PRISM implementation has (in each state's STEW), a single
"increment state" bit.

In any state where the 'inc' bit is set and the LUT output is FALSE (i.e no jump),
then the state will increment to the next state, and the "starting state" of the first occurance
of this will be saved (i.e. start of loop).  Then each successive state can test a different set of
inputs to jump to different states.  When a state is encountered with the 'inc' bit NOT set, PRISM
will loop back to the "starting state" and loop through that set of states until the first TRUE
from a LUT causing a jump, clearing the loop.

### TL/DR
  1. Load a Chroma defining the FSM and enable PRISM.
  2. State starts at zero.
  3. Each state chooses up to 3 of 16 inputs via config bits.
  4. 2-input LUT decides if "jump to defined state" occurs.
  5. Increment bit decides if "state looping" is in effect.
  6. State looping ends when first LUT jump occurs.
  7. Outputs bits from STEW for "non-jump" and "transitional jump".
  8. One conditional output based on single selected input per state.

## External PRISM Inputs

Inputs to the PRISM engine come from the ui_in[6:0] pins of the TinyTapeout ASIC
(pin 7 is not used as this is a UART pin for TinyQV).  All 7 ui_in[6:0] pins are
directly selectable by the running chroma for state transition or conditional output decisions.

![](08_inputs.png)

In addition to direct input to the PRISM, a few inputs also have special functions
(refer to the diagram below for visual).  Input ui_in[0] can be programmatically latched
by the chroma using PRISM out[2] when configured via the ctrl_reg latch2 and latch_in_out bits.
The latched input version becomes available on PRISM input in[12].  This allows for detection
of rising or falling edges.

Additionally any one of inputs in[3:0] can be used as shift register "shift_in_data" to
feed the 8-bit and 24-bit shift registers.  Selection of which pin of in[3:0] is made
using ctrl_reg field "shift_in_sel".

The diagram also shows that shift_out_data can be latched via the out[5] signal.
It is to allow protocols like SPI to present serial output data on one edge while
shifting occurs on the opposite edge (by selecting in[13] as the controlling input
for the cond_out[0] conditional output.

The in[13:12] inputs to PRISM can also be driven by the registered version of out[6] and out[1] bits.
This allows a chroma to use a single FSM state to perform multiple output operations using the
in-state vs. transitional outputs.  For instance, the shift_en signal is output on out[6].
The following code will perform a rising plus falling shift edge in a single FSM state since
a registered version of the shift_en is used to detect when to transition to the next state.

    STATE_SHIFT_BITS:
       begin
          // Shift the next bit out
          shift_en = 1'b1;

          // Detect the rising shift_en bit to go to next state
          if (shift_en_in)
          begin
             next_state = STATE_DELAY;
             shift_en = 1'b0;
          end
       end


## External PRISM Outputs

The PRISM has 11 outputs, 7 of which (out[6:0]) can directly drive uo_out[7:1] pins. 
Note that uo_out[0] is not used since it is the TinyQV UART TX pin.  However some of the out[6:0]
outputs from PRISM also have special functions, and the uo_out[7:1] pins also have muxes allowing
other types of output (such as shift_out data, conditional out, etc.).  Below is a diagram of the
external outputs for the PRISM peripheral.

![](08_outputs.png)

Outputs uo_out[1], out[5] and out[7] are controled directly by PRISM outputs 0,4 and 6 respectively.
Though PRISM out[6] also serves as the "shift_enable" signal when performing either an 8-bit or 24-bit
shift operation (via enable bits in the ctrl_reg).

Outputs uo_out[4:2] can be driven either directly from PRISM out[3:1], or can have muxed data:

 - cond_out_sel (2-bits) when non-zero selects cond_out[0] conditional output.

Outputs uo_out[7:5] can be driven either directly from PRISM out[6:4], or can have muxed data:

 - shift_out_sel (2-bits) when non-zero selects 8 or 24 bit shift out data.

Output uo_out[0] can be driven either directly from PRISM out[0] or can be the "fifo_full" signal
when fifo_24 and latch2 config bits are set in ctrl_reg (more on those bits in the 3-Byte FIFO section).

## Peripherals

The PRISM Peripheral has, itself, peripherals.  Those are:
  1. 8-Bit communication shift register (left or right)
  2. 8-Bit count up/down register with compare (dedicated compare reg or comm register).
  3. 24-bit register: Count down with zero detect, shift left / right or 3-byte FIFO
  4. 5-bit Shift bit counter (automatic)
  5. Input shift data source selection
  6. Output shift data destination selection
  7. Conditional output destination selection
  8. Controllable latched inputs (2-bits)

## 8-Bit Counter (count2)

The 8-bit counter is an up/down/clear counter controllable from the PRISM chroma.  There are three
PRISM outputs plus a ctrl_reg bit that contols the operation (see figure below).  Upon reset (or disabling
PRISM) the count will be zero.  In any PRISM state, the counter can be cleared, incremented or decremented
(assuming decrement has been enabled via the count2_dec ctrl_reg bit).  The decrement is provided as 
a configurable feature in case it is not needed but uo_out[6] is needed (since they share the same out[5] signal).

![](08_8bit_counter.png)

The current 8-bit count2 value is compared against both the 8-bit count2_compare register (fixed register accessible
by TinyQV with R/W access) *and* the comm_data register (also R/W accessible).  The result of each of these
compares are made available on PRISM inputs in[11] and in[15].  A running chroma can use these compare inputs
for timing, terminal count checking, etc.


## Chroma

Chroma are PRISM's version of "personalities".  Each chroma is a unique hue of PRISM's
spectrum of behavior. Chroma's are coded as Mealy state machines in Verilog to define FSM
inputs, outputs and state transitions:

    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n)
       if (~rst_n)
          curr_state <= 3'h0;
       else
          curr_state <= fsm_enable ? next_state : 'h0;
 
    always_comb
    begin
       pin_out[5:0]   = 6'h0;
       count1_dec     = 1'b0;
       etc.
 
       case (curr_state)
       STATE_IDLE:       // State 0
          begin
             // Detect I/O shift start 
             if (host_in[HOST_START])
             begin
                // Load inputs 
                pin_out[GPIO_LOAD] = 1'b0;
 
                // Load 24-bit shift register from preload (our OUTPUTS)
                count1_load = 1'b1;
                next_state = STATE_LATCH_INPUTS;
             end
          end
       STATE_LATCH_INPUTS:  // State 1
          begin
             next_state = STATE_SHIFT_BITS;
          end
       etc.
    end

Chroma are compiled into PRISM programmable bitstreams via a custom fork of Yosys (see link below)
using a configuration file describing the architecture in the TinyQV PRISM peripheral.  In addition
to bitstream generation, the Yosys PRISM backend also calculates the ctrl_reg value for 
configuring the PRISM peripheral muxes, etc.  There are several output formats including C,
Python and columnar list:

| ST | Mux0 | Mux1 | Mux2 | Inc | JmpA | OutA | Out | CfgA | CfgB |        STEW |

## How to test

1.  First define a Chroma FSM transitions, inputs and outputs.
2.  Write Verilog to describe your FSM in Mealy format.
3.  Specify the Control Word Mux and options bit settings in the Verilog:
    shift_en:    Enable shifter mode in either comm_data or 24-bit count1
    shift_24_en: Specify if shift is comm_data or count1
    shift_dir:   Set left or right shift direction
    fifo_24:     Use 24-bit count1 as RX FIFO
    etc.
4.  Clone and build the custom Yosys fork for generating PRISM bitstreams.  (2)
5.  Generate your chroma bitstream using the PRISM Yosys version. (3)
6.  Copy the generated chroma and ctrl_reg value from either the .py or .c file.
7.  Pass the chroma and ctrl_reg value to the "load_chroma" function.
8.  The chroma should start running immediately.

  (1) See examples in chromas directory.
  (2) The Makefile in the chromas directory has a 'make yosys' target for cloning and building this from github sources.
  (3) If you put your chroma in the 'chromas' directory and follow the naming convention, simply typing 'make' within that directory will build your chroma.  Results appear in the 'output' directory.

## External hardware

No external HW required other than anything custom you might want to control from the programmable FSM.
