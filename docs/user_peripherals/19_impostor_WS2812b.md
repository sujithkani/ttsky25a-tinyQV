# WS2812B impostor

Author: Javier MS

Peripheral index: 19

## What it does

This module emulates the behavior of a WS2812B addressable RGB LED. It is designed to integrate  into a daisy-chained WS2812B LED strip, acting as a "virtual LED" or "impostor" within the chain.

It receives data on the `DIN` input pin (typically connected to the previous LED in the chain or a microcontroller), extracts and stores the RGB values destined for it, and then forwards the remaining data to the next element in the chain via the `DOUT` output pin.     

[Demo video on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7353011346612850689/)

This passthrough behavior mimics a real WS2812B LED. This allows the module to coexist with actual LEDs or other impostor modules in a daisy-chain configuration.

Applications:
- Simulation or logging tools for WS2812B protocols.
- Its cool as hell, how about instead of colours we control servos.

> **Note:** The WS2812B protocol sends colors in **GRB** order. This peripheral captures and reorders them internally for convenience.

## Prescaler Configuration

The peripheral allows tuning of internal timing thresholds by writing 16-bit values into shadow registers:

- `shadow_idle_ticks` defines how long the line must stay low to consider the bus idle 50000ns.    
 Is calculated as idle_ticks=50000/(clk_preiod_ns), for example with a clock of 64Mhz (or T=15.625ns) idle_ticks=50000/15,625=3200
- `shadow_threshold_cycles` defines the pulse width threshold (in clock cycles) to determine if a bit is a `1` or a `0` 900 ns.    
Is calculated as threshold_cycles=900/(clk_preiod_ns), for example with a clock of 64Mhz (or T=15.625ns) threshold_cycles=900/15,625=58 (57.6)
These values **only take effect** after writing to `prescaler_commit` (address `0x05`), making the update atomic.
The default preescaler values after reset are 3840 and 38, configured to work with a clock ≈62.5 MHz (T=16ns sharp), but probably there is enough wiggle room in the ws2812b timing tolerances to work with 64Mhz aswel with default configurations.    

## How to Test

1. (Optional) Adjust timing parameters if needed: (prescalers are for 62.5 MHz clock by default after reset)
   - Write a new 32-bit `idle_ticks` value to addresses `0x04–0x07`
   - Write a new 32-bit `threshold_cycles` value to addresses `0x0C–0x0F`
   - Write any value to `prescaler_commit` (e.g. `0xFF`) to address `0x05` to **commit** the new values

2.  (Optional) Select DIN input:(DIN is `ui_in[1]` by default after reset)
   - Write a new 8-bit `din_select` value to addresses `0x010`

3. Connect a WS2812B signal generator (e.g. microcontroller or FPGA) to the `DIN` input (default:`ui_in[1]`).

4. Transmit a standard WS2812B data frame with one or more 3-byte RGB values.

5. Once the first 8×3 = 24 bits are received, the peripheral will:
   - Store the first RGB triplet in the internal registers
   - Set the `rgb_ready` register to `0xFF` to indicate data availability

6. You can now read:
   - `reg_r` (0x00) for RED
   - `reg_g` (0x01) for GREEN
   - `reg_b` (0x02) for BLUE

7. To acknowledge the received data and re-arm the peripheral:
   - Write `0x00` to the `rgb_clear` register (0x03)
   - The `rgb_ready` flag will automatically reset to `0x00`

## External Hardware

- **WS2812B Driver or Controller** (e.g. microcontroller, FPGA logic, cheap chinese led driver)
- **Additional WS2812B LEDs or Impostor Modules**:
  This peripheral supports forwarding of the remaining data to downstream LEDs via the `DOUT` pin, enabling full compatibility with mixed chains of real and imposter devices.
