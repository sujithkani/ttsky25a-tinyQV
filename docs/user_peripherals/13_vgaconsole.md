The peripheral index is the number TinyQV will use to select your peripheral.  You will pick a free
slot when raising the pull request against the main TinyQV repository, and can fill this in then.  You
also need to set this value as the PERIPHERAL_NUM in your test script.

# VGA character console

Author: Ciro Cattuto

Peripheral index: 13

## What it does

The peripheral provides a 10x3 character VGA console supporting printable ASCII characters (32-126). It generates a VGA signal (1024x768 at 60Hz) suitable for a [TinyVGA PMOD](https://github.com/mole99/tiny-vga). The 10x3 text buffer is memory-mapped, hence it is possible to set individual characters using simple writes to the peripheral's registers. Non-printable ASCII codes are displayed as a filled block. The peripheral triggers the user interrupt once per frame refresh. The console text is uninitialited at reset.

## Register map

- The 10x3 character buffer is exposed via registers `CHAR0` to `CHAR29`. When writing to these registers, only the lowest 7 bits of the written value are processed.
- `TXTCOL` controls the text color (6 bits, 2 bits per channel, BBGGRR order). Bit 7 control text transparency: text color is ORed with background color when bit 7 is set. The default text color is green (001100).
- `BGCOL` controls the background color (6 bits, 2 bits per channel, BBGGRR order). The default background color is dark blue (010000).
- `VGA' provides access to VGA timing signals: bit 0 is the blank signal, and bit 1 is vsync.

| 0x30    | TXTCOL | R/W    | Text color (low 6 bits), bit 7 (T) controls transparency: TxBBGGRR  |
| 0x31    | BGCOL  | R/W    | Background color, low 6 bits: xxBBGGRR                              |
| 0x32    | VGA    | R      | VGA status: blank (bit 0), vsync (bit 1)                             |         

## How to test

Write 65 to register CHAR0. An "A" character should appear at the top left of the VGA display.

## External hardware

[TinyVGA PMOD](https://github.com/mole99/tiny-vga) for VGA output.
