## What it does

This project implements a simple 8-bit Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) peripheral, designed as a memory-mapped device for integration with a RISC-V SoC in the TinyTapeout ecosystem.

It allows the user to set a duty cycle via a single register. The peripheral compares an internal 8-bit counter with the programmed duty cycle value and drives `uo_out[0]` high whenever the counter is less than the duty cycle, and low otherwise. This behavior creates a repeating PWM signal that can be used to control brightness, speed, or other analog-like control signals.

The design is minimal, fully synthesizable, and compatible with the TinyQVP peripheral interface.

## Register map

| Address | Name       | Access | Description                                  |
|---------|------------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| 0x00    | DUTY_CYCLE | R/W    | Sets the 8-bit PWM duty cycle (0–255)        |

- **Write**: Writing to address `0x00` updates the duty cycle register.
- **Read**: Reading from address `0x00` returns the current duty cycle.

## How to test

This peripheral is tested using a Cocotb testbench with the TinyQVP simulation infrastructure.

### To run the test locally:

```bash
cd test
